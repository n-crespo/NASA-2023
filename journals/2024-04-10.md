## Notes on Feb 28 Journal

- $y = T$ is the top of the corridor
- $y = 0$ is the bottom of the corridor
- $V$ is the max and $-V$ is the minimum velocity in the y direction
- Drone A is approaching drone B, and A is the one we can control.
- We will try to find the largest possible distance drone A needs to be from
  drone B to fully veer to safety and exit the corridor.

To account for the worst possible scenario, assume Drone A is and has reached
its max velocity while heading towards $y=T$. We can calculate how long it will
take to reach $y=T$ with $V_f^2 = V_0^2 + 2a(\Delta x)$ by making the final y
velocity 0.

$$0 ={V}^2 + 2 (-D)(T-y)$$
$$-(V^2) = -2D(T-y)$$
$$-(V^2) = -2DT+2Dy$$
$$2DT-(V^2) = 2Dy$$
$$T - \frac{V^2}{2D} = y$$

So, to ensure the drone doesn't pass $y = T$, it must start $\frac{V^2}{2D}$
away from $y = T$.

---

Lets assume that once the drone reaches $y = T$, it will be at y velocity 0, and
as it begins its descent it will start accelerating towards $y = 0$. The
velocity in the x direction will remain constant.

Now, we can use this information to determine the time it will take for the
drone to reach the same distance from $y = T$ on the other side of the parabola
it is forming with $\Delta y = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}a(t^2)$. Let's substitute known
values:

$$0 = Vt + \frac{1}{2}(-D)(t^2)$$

And apply the quadratic equation to find the two roots:

$$
a = \frac{-D}{2}
\qquad
b = V
\qquad
c = 0
\qquad
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

$$t = \frac{-V \pm \sqrt{V^2-4(\frac{-D}{2})(0)}}{-D} $$
$$t = \frac{-V \pm \sqrt{V^2}}{-D} $$
$$t = \frac{-V \pm V}{D} $$

$$
t = 0
\qquad
t = \frac{2V}{D}
$$

Since we know how long it will take for the drone to complete the parabola, we
can now calculate how far it will have traveled in the x direction with the
following equation:

> NOTE: we are assuming constant velocity in the x direction

$$\Delta x =v_x(t)$$
$$\Delta x = v_x (\frac{2V}{D})$$

Since the drone began its parabola at max y velocity, $V$, we can safely assume
that at an identical y location on the opposite side of the parabola the drone
has velocity $-V$. We can use this to find out how long it will now take to
reach the bottom of the corridor, $y = 0$, and once again calculate the distance
the drone will travel in the x direction.

$$\Delta y = v_y(t)$$
$$y_f - y_0= v_y(t)$$
$$y_f = y_0 + v_y(t)$$
$$0 = (T - \frac{V^2}{2D}) - Vt$$
$$T + \frac{A^2}{2D} = At$$
$$\frac{T}{A} + \frac{A}{2D} = t$$
$$\Delta x = v_x(\frac{T}{A} + \frac{A}{2D})$$

This gives us the time from the start of the reversionary program to when the
drone hits $y=0$ to exit the corridor. After adding the distance the drone
traveled in the original parabola, we can calculate _the distance that drone A
must be from its intersection point with drone B so that it has the room it
needs to safely exit the corridor_, $\Delta x$:

$$\Delta x = v_x(\frac{T}{A} + \frac{A}{2D}) + v_x(\frac{2A}{D})$$
$$\Delta x = v_x(\frac{T}{A} + \frac{5A}{2D})$$
