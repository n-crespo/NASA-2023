- watched Tanner's lecture about [PVS], [RTA] and [Plaidypvs] which integrates [Differential Dynamic Logic] into [PVS], now recreating differential equations from textbook using [Plaidypvs] (hopefully)
- Learned more about [Hybrid Programs] with Andre's book (CMU prof, super cool textbook, began watching his lectures about his textbook because it is not available for free)
- {{video(https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnQeVMgmt_JdGIqhUDNoKQsPPWRjZzIo_)}}
- turns out HP is a pretty well documented field (mostly that one dude), [Plaidypvs] is just one way to prove/reason about similar HP's (Andre uses [KeYmaera], not the same as [DL]/[Plaidypvs] in [PVS])
- attended talk about Modeling stuff with some program and safety assurance or something
- MODELED a Bernoulli's differential equation, (kinda copied some documentation), but was unable to manually prove the solution to be correct
- finding model-able equations inside of this list:

- hard to fully understand most...
