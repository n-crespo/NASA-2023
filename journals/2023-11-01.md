Today was short because I got in late, but I was able to regenerate the
counterexamples in KeYmaera for Example 1e, and I ended up with some very
strange values, including a negative time variable. This was probably our fault,
when we created a witness we probably used the wrong value/equation. Definitely
something to look at tomorrow, when I will meet in person with Tanner. 

I'm also beginning to work on the PVS specification for Example 1e, and later on
I will attempt the complication example that Tanner told me about, Example 2.
