- Today I talked about a physics problem with Tanner
- In this problem, an imperfect controller controls a car. The controller is
imperfect because it can only do anything in "tau" intervals, tau being a
measure of time. At each time, the controller can change the car's acceleration
to A or -A, instantaneously. The idea is that the car is approaching a wall at x
= W, but we want the car to stop at a point a bit before W, W-D.
  My idea for writing a proof for this was that at every tau, the controller
would check if the position and velocity of itself in the future if it chose
either A, or -A, and decide what to do depending on those outcomes.
