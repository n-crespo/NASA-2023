- went through a *bunch* of documentation for PVS and NASA Lib dL
- theres a lot less for DL than plain PVS
- Trying to learn more about [DIFF](../pages/DIFF.md), HP (Hybrid Programs)
- Diff only takes first order Differential equations, maybe potential for improvement?
- hard to think about translating higher order to first order
- what is a lemma...
- NEED TO LEARN ABOUT UNION and other similar functions defined in datatype, but
not very well documented
- going through DL Examples (exp growth first, trying to understand how to use
the DL@TOP library)
