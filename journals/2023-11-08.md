Today my goal is to transliterate the Example 1e proof to PVS, and also transfer
the other PVS example (flying drone collision) to PVS. Shouldn't be too hard. 

NOTE: I also removed the definition of the variable `xi`, because it is unused.
It was previously used in the second ODE for the derivation of a certain
equation, but by definition the initial position of the vehicle if it is running
the second ODE will always be the buffer point `bf`, so saving a witness
variable for the initial position is unnecessary. 

Update: I'm almost done with the PVS proof specification, still fighting with
some parenthesis problems though.
