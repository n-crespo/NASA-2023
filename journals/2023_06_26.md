- IMPORTANT: use `dl-flatten` when.... `DLIMPLIES` #flatten
- IMPORTANT: use expand to get function definitions #expand
- IMPORTANT: skeep when FORALL #skeep
- `diff-ghost`: #ghosts
	- you are trying to prove x is always positive (it approaches 0 as it reaches infinity)
	- you introduce a new equation: `y' = y/2`
	- then you can say that `x*y^2=1`
	- why? because y^2 is always positive, so anything that x is must also be positive
	- y acts as a counterweight, always lifting x just enough to remain positive
	- questions:
		- how do you figure out what y should equal?
			- GO BACKWARDS
			- we know that you have to use [[diffinv]] right after you introduce the ghost, so do that and have an unkown j(x) as the ghost
			- you should end up with an equation that = 0, so find the ghost expression that can satisfy it
			- THATS IT
		- how can you know for sure that `xy^2=1?
			- that is just a property of any positive number (x), use some reasoning to find small expressions like that that work for all numbers so you can build ghost variables around them
		- the new function must exist for as long as or longer than the original function that you are reasoning about
		-
- `diffinv`: #diffinv
	- use it after `diffghost` #ghosts
	- when you have a HP and something you want to prove is true (the HP would define the movement of the variable in the equation), differentiate the equation (and make sure to use values like x', y', etc) and plug in the values that you know those primes are equal to (from the HP definition)
	- you should get stuff that cancels out !!
	- (or rather an equation that equals 0)
