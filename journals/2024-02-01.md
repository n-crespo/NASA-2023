## The New dL

The dL_vars example lists the function `dlvar`, but it is unclear if this
should be used.

UPDATE: the `dLVar` function should ***NOT*** be used.

A changing variable can be described like this: 

```java
pairwise_distinct_vars((:x, y, z:))
```

A constant variable (A, W, and D in this example) can be described like this: 

```java
 RTA_simple_break_0: LEMMA
  FORALL(A,W,D,tau:posreal):
     (W-D > 0 AND tau <= sqrt(((W - D) / A))) IMPLIES
  LET  tstar: real = sqrt((W-D)/A),
       ttau: real  =  max(sqrt((W-D)/A)- tau,0),
       star: real = (W-D)/2,
       stau: real = A*ttau^2/2,
       vstar: real = A*tstar,
       vtau: real = A*ttau,
       P = val(s) <= cnst(W-D),
       S = (val(s) <= cnst(stau) AND val(v) <= cnst(vtau)),
       G = (val(s) <= cnst(star) AND val(v) <= cnst(vstar))
  IN 
  ((: (val(s)= cnst(0) AND val(v) = cnst(0)) :) |- (: ALLRUNS(simple_break_RTA(A,D,S,tau),P) :))

```

Another Example where `G` is a constant: 

```java
% general low confidence vontroller, with monitor gaurd
lc(G:posreal): HP =
 DIFF(lc_odes, val(x)^2+val(y)^2 <= cnst(G)^2)
```

DIFF() and ASSIGN() are different. This: `>>` syntax is used in both. See [this
file](../assets/learning/dlvars_example.pvs) for an example of how to use the
new syntax


See [this file](../assets/learning/RTA_brake_ex.pvs ) for the new RTA function
that I am going to generalize Example 2 to fit to. 

## Working on Example 2

Upon further consideration, there are some cases that need to be taken into
account:

* Both drones are at exact same velocity and acceleration, Drone a intercepts
Drone b's path out of the corridor at wall B. We have make sure the monitor
checks at a time where, even at max velocity/acceleration for both drones, Drone
b makes it out of the corridor before Drone a.
  * Assume Drone a is intentionally trying to collide with Drone b

* Drone b is moving very slow. Slow enough to where the monitor triggers and the
reversionary system starts exiting the corridor very early, to ensure drone b has
enough time to get to safety
  * The conditions at which the monitor triggers the reversionary system must
  take into account drone b's current velocity and acceleration. This
  information can be used to determine 

* If both drones are at the same velocity and start accelerating at exactly the
same time, they will reach the same point on the x axis at the same time. Thus,
drone b must start moving out of the way of drone a when drone a is at a
distance where it can reach Wall B and still be separated (x) from drone b. 

* Both the x and y velocity must be considered, but the x velocity should be
what the monitor checks. The y velocity is important only because it determines
how fast drone b can exit the corridor.
