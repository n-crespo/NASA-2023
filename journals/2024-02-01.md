## Writing Example 1 with new dL

The dL_vars example lists the function `dlvar`, but it is unclear if this
should be used. 

> The following use of dLVars is OK in examples, but
> it should be avoided in general as the theorems are not
> general for all dLVars (only those defined by the constants)

In `../assets/RTA_Examples/example_1/pvs_proofs/Example1e.pvs`, I have update
the specification to use the new dL variables.
