Today I am working in the office with Tanner. We met for about 40 minutes to
talk about DTL, which is an extension of differential logic called differential
side `ALLRUNS` and `SOMERUNS` temporal logic that includes existential like
`eventually` and `always`.

See [DTL.md](../pages/DTL.md)

The virtual machine for using Linux on my Mac (NASA laptop) stopped working
today, but thankfully I also got PVS *and* KeYmaera working on my personal
laptop. I rebuilt the [1e proof](../pages/Example1e.md) with our progress we made
last week, but now I need to reconfigure and get an access key for Wolfram
Alpha, which will provide a more advanced logical engine than Z3, the default
on KeYmaera. Wolfram Alpha will also give me counterexamples so I can see
possible situations where the proof has some fallacy.
