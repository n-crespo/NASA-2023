## Reviewing Changes to PVS

Today I looked through Cesar's PowerPoint
[presentation](https://nasa.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/teams/FM4SCS/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BD5313D78-D3E6-462B-B7B8-9E86765754B8%7D&file=PVS%20Status%20January%202024.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&PreviousSessionID=9496487f-437b-42b5-ba42-ae41f984f47f)
about the status of PVS Version 8. Lots of things seem to have changed and there
seems be some progress on the `dl-solve` tactic. Also, the case insensitivity in
the new compiler caused a lot of code to have be re-written. One major change is
that from here on out, PVS commands should **always** be surrounded by
parenthesis, and arguments must be surrounded with quotes. There is also a new
way to deal with `dL` variables, which I will cover in the next section.
