- waiting for cesar to come so I can fix the diffghost and the ghosts example
- I wonder why there are no Hybrid Programs in my notes
- today I learned:
  - KeYmaera can run in the image, not locally
    - run command `java -jar keymaerax.jar`
    - open keymaera with this: <http://127.0.0.1:8090/>
