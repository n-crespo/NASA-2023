Today I met with Tanner to discuss a certain competition posting that has gained
popularity in the theorem proving world. The competition claims a $5mil prize
for any person who can build an open source AI/ML model that can humanly analyze
and perform at the level of a Math Olympiad Gold Medalist. Many of the questions
come in the form of a proof to be solved or shown, which is the main focus of
theorem provers. Still, even specifying the questions Tanner and I looked at in
PVS would be difficult, and we could barely begin to solve them ourselves.

In the future, I will be focusing on working on the following things: 

<!--  TODO: for next week -->
- [ ] Prove Example 1 until I hit a wall (due to Plaidypvs limitations)
- [ ] Review Example 2 (see [this journal entry](../journals/2023-11-08.md))
- [ ] Specify Example 2 in PVS
- [ ] Read the short RTA Paper
