- finally proving the dl_cooling property
  - tanner helped me fix this one tiny error
  - used `val` instead of `cnst`
  - we'll see how this goes
- going to watch Tanner's talk about RTA and Plaidypvs
- began using emacs
- uh oh
- stuff not working
- (like pvs commands)
- tanner leaving tomorrow...
