- LEARNED NEW command
	- `div_safe_re`
		- division + safe + real expression
		- takes 2 things, numerator and denominator
		- USE THIS when you're not sure if the denominator isn't 0. (its safe)
		- generally used in tandem with dl-instt (which instantiates a new equation)
	- `lemma sqrt_hathat`
		- recognizes when an real exponentiation (^^) is 1/2 and converts that to sqrt()
	- `^^`: exponentiation to a real number
		- ^ only accepts nat numbers because their easy to work with, much simpler definition
