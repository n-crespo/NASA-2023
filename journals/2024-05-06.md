The monitor will check the velocity of drone b once the reversionary procedure
begins, so to assume the worst possible scenario we must assume that the drone
immediately begins accelerating at the max acceleration until it reaches the max
velocity and continues at at a constant speed. This is what a basic version of
that could look like in code:

$v_max$ is the maximum $x$ velocity of the drones.

```python
if t <= v_max / a:
        # During the acceleration phase (0 <= t <= v_x / a)
        delta_x = 0.5 * a * t**2
    else:
        # During the constant velocity phase (t > v_x / a)
        delta_x = v_max * t - 0.5 * (v_max**2) / a
```

However, the above assumes an initial velocity of 0. To reduce this to one
mathematical expression (which may or may not be needed) and account for an
initial velocity, we can use `max()` and `min()` (assuming we can use those).

The combined position function can be expressed as:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

$$
\Delta x =
[\frac{1}{2}a\times\text{min}(t, \frac{v_{max} - v_{initial}}{a})^2] +
[v_{max}\times\text{max}(0, (t-\frac{v_{max} - v_{initial}}{a}))]
$$

> Simplified form of this equation:

$$ \Delta x = \frac{1}{2} a \times t^\prime + v_{max} \times (tâˆ’t^\prime) $$
$$t^\prime = \frac{v_{max} - v_{initial}}{a}$$

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

> TODO: Continue from here, fix the above expressions

We also know from this equation:

$$\Delta x = v_x(\frac{T}{v_y} + \frac{3v_y}{2D})$$

That the drone A needs $t= (\frac{T}{3v_y} + \frac{v_y}{2D})$ to complete its
reversionary procedure.
