# Goals

- [ ] equation for distance from a line to a point
- [x] think about how to determine where the reversionary needs to start so that
drone b will be safe

Consider the following:

First, I am making some assumptions about the problem. First, the *worst*
possible scenario, or the one where it will take drone b the *longest* amount
of time to decelerate and scape the corridor that it is at some location in
between $y = 0$ and $y = T$ ($T$ being the top of the corridor), it being at max
velocity ($A$), and max acceleration. This way, the drone must decelerate from
positive $A$ to $-A$ to exit the corridor.

So, I will try using this equation:

$$V_f^2 = V_i^2 + 2A(T-y)$$

Since the final velocity (or the velocity at $y = T$) should be 0, the initial
velocity is the *max* velocity ($A$), and assuming $-D$ is the acceleration once
the reversionary controller begins, we get this: 

$$0 = A^2 + 2 (-D)(T-y)$$

Now, to solve for y: 

$$-(A^2) = -2D(Tâˆ’y)$$

$$-(A^2) = -2DT+2Dy$$

$$2DT-(A^2) = 2Dy$$

$$T-\frac{A^2}{2D} = y$$

So, to ensure the drone doesn't pass $y = T$, it must start $\frac{A^2}{2D}$
away from y = T, where $A$ is its max velocity and $D$ is its max
acceleration/deceleration.
