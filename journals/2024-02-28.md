# Goals

- [ ] equation for distance from a line to a point
- [x] think about how to determine where the reversionary needs to start so that
drone b will be safe

Consider the following:

First, I am making some assumptions about the problem. First, the *worst*
possible scenario, or the one where it will take drone b the *longest* amount
of time to decelerate and escape the corridor that it is at some location in
between $y = 0$ and $y = T$ ($T$ being the top of the corridor), it being at max
velocity ($A$), and max acceleration. This way, the drone must decelerate from
positive $A$ to $-A$ to exit the corridor.

So, I will try using this equation:

$$V_f^2 = V_i^2 + 2A(T-y)$$

Since the final velocity (or the velocity at $y = T$) should be 0, the initial
velocity is the *max* velocity ($A$), and assuming $-D$ is the acceleration once
the reversionary controller begins, we get this: 

$$0 = A^2 + 2 (-D)(T-y)$$

Now, to solve for y: 

$$-(A^2) = -2D(Tâˆ’y)$$

$$-(A^2) = -2DT+2Dy$$

$$2DT-(A^2) = 2Dy$$

$$T-\frac{A^2}{2D} = y$$

So, to ensure the drone doesn't pass $y = T$, it must start $\frac{A^2}{2D}$
away from y = T, where $A$ is its max velocity and $D$ is its max
acceleration/deceleration.

Now, we can use the $y$ position, velocity, and acceleration to determine the
time it will take the drone to reach the same distance from $y=T$ on the other
side of the parabola, where it will have a velocity of $A$ and an acceleration
of 0, since it will have reached its max velocity.

Using this equation:

$$y = y_0 + v_0t + \frac{1}{2}a(t^2)$$

Since the $y$ position is the same (it now is the same distance from $T$ as when
it started), we can simplify:

$$0 = At + \frac{1}{2}a(t^2)$$

Since the acceleration is $-D$, we can rewrite:

$$0 = At + \frac{1}{2}(-D)(t^2)$$

And apply the quadratic formula:

$$
a = \frac{-D}{2}
\qquad
b = A
\qquad
c = 0
\qquad
t = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

$$ t = \frac{-A \pm \sqrt{A^2-4(\frac{-D}{2})(0)}}{-D} $$
$$ t = \frac{-A \pm \sqrt{A^2}}{-D} $$
$$ t = \frac{A \pm A}{D} $$

$$
t = 0
\qquad
t = \frac{2A}{D}
$$

Since we know now how long it will take for the drone to complete the parabola,
we can calculate how far away it will end up from its original position (in x
coordinates) with the following equation:

$$x = x_0 + v_0t + \frac{1}{2}a(t^2)$$

Assuming the x velocity has always remained constant at some arbitrary value of
$v_x$:

$$\Delta x = v_x (\frac{2A}{D}) + \frac{1}{2}a(\frac{2A}{D})^2$$

Since velocity is constant and $a = 0$, the distance the drone has covered since
it began its curved parabola is:

$$\Delta x = v_x (\frac{2A}{D})$$

Now, the $y$ velocity of the drone is -A. We can use this to find out how long
it will take for it to reach $y=0$:

$$y = y_0 + v_0t + \frac{1}{2}a(t^2)$$

Since velocity is constant at $-A$ and $a = 0$:

$$y = (T - \frac{A^2}{2D}) - At $$

Since the final $y$ position is 0:

$$0 = (T - \frac{A^2}{2D}) - At $$

Simplify:

$$T + \frac{A^2}{2D} = At$$
$$\frac{T + \frac{A^2}{2D}}{A} = t$$
$$\frac{T}{A} + \frac{A}{2D} = t$$

Considering that the velocity in the $x$ direction is constant at $v_x$:

$$\Delta x = v_x (\frac{T}{A}+\frac{A}{2D})$$

Now, we can add this to our previously defined $\Delta x$ to get the final
distance (in terms of $x$) from the point where the reversionary controller
activated to when the drone reaches $y=0$:

$$\Delta x = v_x (\frac{T}{A}+\frac{A}{2D}) + v_x (\frac{2A}{D})$$
$$\Delta x = v_x (\frac{T}{A}+\frac{A}{2D} + \frac{2A}{D})$$
$$\Delta x = v_x (\frac{T}{A}+\frac{A}{2D} + \frac{4A}{2D})$$
$$\Delta x = v_x (\frac{T}{A}+\frac{5A}{2D})$$

<!-- TODO: Ask Tanner to confirm the correctness of the above math.-->

Given this distance, we can say that drone b must begin its reversionary path at
when it is at least double that distance from drone a so that it can safely exit
the corridor.
