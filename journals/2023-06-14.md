- back to looking through nasalib/[dl] files and documentation
- will update with any progress or good information
- made good toronto progress
	- recreating [KeYMaera] Differential Equation with `IFTE()` inside [DL][PVS]
- Ended up using [IFTE], not [UNION]
- need to learn how to assign stuff and do basic functions in [DL] (not the same as [KeYMaera] tutorial)
