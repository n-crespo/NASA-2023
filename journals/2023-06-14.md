- back to looking through nasalib/dL files and documentation
- will update with any progress or good information
- made good Toronto progress
  - recreating KeYmaera Differential Equation with `IFTE()` inside DLPVS
- Ended up using `IFTE`, not `UNION`
- need to learn how to assign stuff and do basic functions in dL (not the same
as KeYmaera tutorial)
