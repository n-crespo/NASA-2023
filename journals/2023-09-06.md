- Thoughts
	- I have to prove (in PVS)
    - when the [star](../pages/star.md) starts, it will either do nothing or do the first ODE
		- immediately after doing the first ODE, it will either remain within the domain constraints or it will be AT bf.
		- If it is at bf, the second HP will run
	- initial condition poses a problem...
		- if initial X is bf
			- if V starts negative and the second ODE runs, it will cause big problems
			- if the V starts at 0 it just wont move
			- similar problems happen if the first ODE ends exactly at bf with a V of 0
- got to this point in proof 1a in PVS:
- ![proof1a_progress](../assets/proof1a_progress.png)
	- used cnst(bf) > cnst(E) as a loop invariant, other precondition ((val(x) < cnst(bf)) doesn't remain true (isnt invariant throughout the proof), but I'm not sure that matters much
- need to redo with full loop invariant, then ask tanner about either splitting up the HPs or creating a ghost variable
- see [loop invariant](../pages/loopinvariant.md)
