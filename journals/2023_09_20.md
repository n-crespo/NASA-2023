- Back to work
- Today I am working on rebuilding the proof I started last week.
	- I spent a good while trying to recreate it, i need to get firefox to actually start in WSL on my own laptop so that I can reconstruct the proof, right now the snap package manager is doing some weird things
- talked to tanner about a cool way to think about limits
	- if you approach a function limit from any path (x=0, y=0, y=x, etc.), the limit at the same value should be the same for all (ALL) paths. if this is different, you can say that the limit does not exist. This can get interesting in three dimensions when the paths you take to get to the limit value can be literally any function.
- Todo
	- rebuild proof in keymaera
	- specify 1e in PVS
	- start the beginning of the proof in PVS
	- check status of other Example proofs that are specified in PVS
- Also I can now telework legally
