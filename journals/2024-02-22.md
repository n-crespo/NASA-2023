# How should the Reversionary Controller work?

## Attempt 1

Consider this equation:

$$ a = A \times ( 2 \times \frac {x-b}{2b}) $$

If we assume x starts at 20 and b is at 10,

$$ a = A \times (2 \times \frac {20-10}{2\*10}) $$

$$ a = A \times (2 \times \frac {10}{20}) $$

$$ a = A \times (2 \times \frac {10}{20}) $$

$$ a = A \times (2 \times \frac {1}{2}) $$

$$ a = A $$

If we assume x starts at 50 and b is at 10,

$$ a = A \times ( 2 \times \frac {50-10}{2\times10})$$

$$ a = A \times ( 2 \times \frac {40}{20})$$

$$ a = A \times ( 2 \times 2)$$

Conclusion: The above does not work.

## Attempt 2

Consider this other equation

$$ a = A \times \frac {|x-b|}{x-b} $$

This should work. Whenever x is above b, a will be A, when it is below b it will
be -A. When x is at b, A will be 0 / 0... Which isn't great. Depending on how
PVS will handle that, it may be awful.

# The Reversionary Controller

What is the closest point between a parabola and line?

The parabola will be going down, the drone will be approaching it, how can we
ensure that drone b is always a certain epsilon away from drone a?

The above could be interesting to prove. (Distance from parabola to a line (epsilon)?)

**VERY IMPORTANT:** I can now assume that the position and velocity of drone A are
always known by drone b. Furthermore, the max velocity is always less than $A$

I believe the worst possible case is that both drones curve down towards point B
and narrowly avoid collision.
