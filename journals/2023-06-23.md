- not sure how to use [dl]-diffghost #ghosts
	- terms seem arbitrary and not connected to actual proof (simple proof really, saying that x'=x, when x >0, x' > 0)
	- seems simple but this command puts in some seemingly unrelated expression
- Logical Foundations of Cyber-Physical Systems #resources
	- # Overview
		- most differential equations are impossible to solve
		- solving ODE's will otfen make them more complicated then necessary
		- discrete systems: induction
			- generically analyze one step of the loop body
			- do the same for differential equation without solving (?)
	- # Ghost Variables
		- discrete ghost #ghosts
			- extra variable introduced to a proof to analyze the model
		- differential ghost #ghosts
			- extra variable added with a made up differential equation to analyze the system
			- increase complexity of the system
			- change the differential equation itself
			- (auxiliary variables) added to make the proof more conclusive, don't really exist
			- discrete ghost: remember the value of a new variable in an old state for analyzing the change of an expression
				- discrete variable y which remembers the value of e (fresh) #[Fresh Variables]
					- fresh = new variable
				- bouncing ball example, create example folder
			- differential [ghosts] evolve over time
