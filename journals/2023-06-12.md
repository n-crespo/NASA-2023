- continuing PVS
- Instantiation: choose arbitrary value for any variable
  - `(inst -1 "1 * 10^12432565")`
- `skeep`
  - uses arbitrary value for variable
  - use this or inst, not both (I think)
- [x] completed all exercises
  - having trouble with quant_2
  - finished quant 2, had to use some obscure command
- EXPAND to prove factorials/recursion] stuff, it defines stuff in terms of the
real declaration of the thing itself, kinda confusing but works
- finished reading KeYMaera tutorial (very little tbf), now trying to write some
of the proofs with PVS using DL NASALib
- quite difficult...
