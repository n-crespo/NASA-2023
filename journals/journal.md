OK so consider this equation: 

$$ a = A * (2 * \frac {x-b}{2b}) $$

If we assume x starts at 20 and b is at 10, 

$$
a = A * (2 * \frac {20-10}{2*10}) \\
a = A * (2 * \frac {10}{20}) \\
a = A * (2 * \frac {10}{20}) \\
a = A * (2 * \frac {1}{2}) \\
a = A * 1 
$$


If we assume x starts at 50 and b is at 10,

$$ a = $$
