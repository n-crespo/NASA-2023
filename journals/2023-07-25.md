- show tanner the lambda thingy you were getting after instantiating (in cooling)
- try to finish the cooling proof IN PVS
- dude its been so long
- working on FINISHING cooling proof, then following proof, THEN consider
outlying controller cases and prove them

## I despise the image

## Why can't NASA WiFi be semi usable

- finally PROVED following cars
- YESSSSS PVS WORKED
- we did it boys
- STILL HAVING TROUBLE THOUGH
- because when I get deep enough down one of the dl_cooling branches the sequent
no longer includes (a), which is defined as 0 in the beginning, and (dl-assert)
cannot simplify an obviously true expression because it doesn't recognize that a
is actually 0
- will work with tanner on that tomorrow, and also ADD A FOLLOWING BUFFER
