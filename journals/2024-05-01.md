## Meeting with Tanner

Today I met with Tanner and discussed the future of this mentorship and plans
for the next meeting. We plan to continue for the next 3 weeks, with our next
meeting focused on the final research paper I am required to write about my
mentorship and the few progressions I have made with the drone collision
avoidance system proof. I am currently working on trying to implement the
changes to the Example 2 math by reading my previous journal entries.
