## Creating more realistic buffer distance pt. 1

Continuing journal entry from last week, see [here](2024-04-10.md)

Assume I do know the velocity of drone b. It is at some velocity, and once I
check that velocity, it starts accelerating at the max acceleration. Depending
on this information, dynamically change the $\Delta x$ equation so that the
buffer distance is not as conservative. This should be fairly simple because I
know the following things:

- how long drone a's reversionary procedure will take
- how far drone a will travel after the reversionary procedure has started
- (after using basic kinematics) how far drone a will travel given its velocity
  and acceleration
