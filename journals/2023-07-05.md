- back to work
- ## today I am going to
	- DONE understand the [KeYmaera] tutorial example
		- DONE learn why the [instantiation] happened
	- DONE text tanner about toronto
	- DONE use [KeYmaera] to solve MY Proof and the example [ghost] proof (exp. decay)
- I found an important bug in the [dl_cooling] proof:
	- the first $k/2$ term has to have a [cnst]() around ALL OF IT
