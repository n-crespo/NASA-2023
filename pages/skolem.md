skolem
======
- this is used when you have a [FORALL](https://github.com/n-crespo/NASA-2023/blob/master/pages/FORALL.md), or a [box](https://github.com/n-crespo/NASA-2023/blob/master/box.md) in logical/KeYmaera notation
- essentially you are telling PVS that since anything will work for some Hybrid Program, it doesn't matter what it is
- this will get rid of a `FORALL( ...) `
- "skolemize", named after a guy
