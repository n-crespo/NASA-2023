# Differential Dynamic Logic

- a concept that has been embedded into PVS in the [dL](../pages/dL.md) part of nasalib
- dL is a PVS embedding, meaning it has its own turnstile and unique commands
  - often has same commands as PVS but with `dl-` in the front
- use dL to create Hybrid Programs which model things both discretely with
regular assignment and continuously with differential equations
