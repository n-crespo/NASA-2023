ghosts
======
- see Differential Equations, Ghosts and Invariants in [the Wiki](pages/Wiki.md)
- new thing to add to a proof to make it solvable
- can be discrete or diff
	- `dl-ghost` vs `dl-diffghost`
- must ALWAYS use Fresh Variables
## NOTE:
- ghosts are especially used when a function or property of a proof gets less and less true over time, like an object cooling down to its ambient temperature but never reaching it, or a function of exponential decay never reaching 0. It is proofs like these that are impossible to solve without ghosts.
