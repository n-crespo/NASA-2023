Annotations
===========
- You can do something similar to KeYmaera's annotations in [PVS], but you have to define such invariants outside of the dL sequent, in the PVS antecedent. Furthermore, whenever you call the invariant, you must use (replace -1) so that dL can actually understand what you are doing rather than only displaying the name of the invariant.

- However, it seems this could be automated and made a lot better
- KeYmaera example:
