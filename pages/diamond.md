diamond
=======
- shown like this: `<dyn>`
- opposite of [box](https://github.com/n-crespo/NASA-2023/blob/master/pages/box.md), which is shown with `[dyn]`
- Diamond is essentially the same as `SOMERUNS` or the backwards "E" logical notation meaning "there exists"
- the "d" stands for [diamond](https://github.com/n-crespo/NASA-2023/blob/master/pages/diamond.md)
