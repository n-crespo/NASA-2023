Exponentiation
==============
- `^` only accepts nat numbers because they are easier for PVS to work with, much simpler definition
- exponentiation to a real number
- done with `^` for natural numbers, and `^^` for real numbers
- can be expanded with `(expand)` 
- see [expand](https://github.com/n-crespo/NASA-2023/blob/master/pages/expand.md)
