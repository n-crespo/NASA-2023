# solve

- Again need to do more research on this, should solve differential equations
- In my case, it _created_ a time variable (whattttttt ðŸ¤¯) when it solved the
  `DIFF` but I got stuck at a step that uses `sub` because the SUB wouldn't
  correctly substitute values into a differential equation, even though it seems
  obvious (this was from the cars following each other example $(xb' = \frac{xa-xb}{2})$)
- seems powerful when used correctly
- to clarify, this is in dL
