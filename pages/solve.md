solve
=====
- Again need to do more research on this, should solve differential equations
- In my case, it *created* a time variable (whattttttt ðŸ¤¯) when it solved the `DIFF` but I got stuck at a step that uses `sub` because the SUB wouldn't correctly substitute values into a differential equation, even though it seems obvious (this was from the cars following each other example $(xb' = (xa-xb)/2)$ )
- seems powerful when used correctly
- to clarify, this is in dL
