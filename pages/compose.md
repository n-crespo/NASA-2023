Compose
=======
- if you are checking if 2 things maintain a post condition, you can split them up and check if each one individually works as well
- useful when you have 2 differential equations with [DIFF](https://github.com/n-crespo/NASA-2023/blob/master/pages/DIFF.md)
- related to `(dl-composed)`, see definition of [b] and [diamond](https://github.com/n-crespo/NASA-2023/blob/master/diamond.md)
- essentially does this:
	- $[A;B]P <-> [A][B]P$
	- does same thing but with a diamond for `composed`
