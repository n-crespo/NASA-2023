Compose
=======
- if you are checking if 2 things maintain a post condition, you can split them up and check if each one individually works as well
- useful when you have 2 differential equations with [DIFF](../pages/DIFF.md)
- related to `(dl-composed)`, see definition of b and [diamond](../pages/diamond.md)
- essentially does this:
	- `[A;B]P <-> [A][B]P`
	- does same thing but with a diamond for `composed`
