loop
====
- need to do more research on this, in the one proof i used it in i simply used the precondition as the argument.
- often proved with [loop invariant](https://github.com/n-crespo/NASA-2023/blob/master/pages/loopinvariant.md)
- Uses induction to prove sometimes
- ex. `(dl-loop "val(xa)>val(xb)")`
