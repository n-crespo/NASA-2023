DLEXISTSRf
==========
- This is NOT a proof rule, but it will appear IN a proof while solving, usually after a [diffghost](https://github.com/n-crespo/NASA-2023/blob/master/pages/diffghost.md)
- this is actually `dl-exitsR` with an `f` at the end...
- According to the documentation:

> Existential quantifier over RealExpr (only for differential ghost rule)

- seen in proof after a [diffghost](https://github.com/n-crespo/NASA-2023/blob/master/pages/diffghost.md) in Glossary
