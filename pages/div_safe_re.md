div_safe_re
===========
- division + safe + real expression
- takes 2 things, numerator and denominator
- USE THIS when you're not sure if the denominator isn't 0. (its safe)
- generally used in tandem with `dl-inst` (which [inst](https://github.com/n-crespo/NASA-2023/blob/master/pages/inst.md)antiates a new equation)
